# Loupe

A simple, small magnification device used to see small image details more closely. 

## Getting started

<!-- To install software and packages, you will need to first run in _both_ the `/` and `/client` folder:

### `yarn install`

To start both the client and backend for local development, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console. -->

## Example

<!-- ### Step 1: Delete the data (clear the database)

```
admin/bin/delete-data.js [database_url] --delete
or
admin/bin/delete-data.js --database-from-env --delete
```

This command clears the database entirely and is the essential first step of the data injest process.

If `--database-from-env` is specified, the DATABASE environment variable (from .env) will be used for the database url.

If `--database-from-env-prod` is specified, the DATABASE_PROD environment variable (from .env) will be used for the database url.

### Step 2: Format and load data into database

```
admin/bin/format-and-load-data.js [data_directory] [database_url]
or
admin/bin/format-and-load-data.js [data_directory] --database-from-env
```

Assigns ids, formats, and injests raw data from the spikeforest pipeline into the website for visualization. Raw data files for injest should be stored in [data_directory] with capitalized titles. After injest is complete, this script automatically deletes temp files generated in the process.

If `--database-from-env` is specified, the DATABASE environment variable (from .env) will be used for the database url.

If `--database-from-env-prod` is specified, the DATABASE_PROD environment variable (from .env) will be used for the database url. -->
